An Introduction to R

After going through the list of free books available from the “free-data-science-book,” I found An introduction to R by W.N. Vemables, D.M and the R Core Team interesting because, although I’ve never used R before, I know that R is used for data analysis and statistical computing. I’ve heard that R can create visualizations ranging from plots, graphs, and scatter plots. I feel that one day I will be using this for professional work.
